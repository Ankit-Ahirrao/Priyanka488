### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Priyanka, a pre-final year student at UPES, Dehradun, pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science.<br>
I am an optimisitic, curious and well-focused developer. <br>
I love building web apps using MERN (MongoDb, Express, React and Node.js)  stack, and I  am currently diving deep into Cloud and Devops technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CircleCi ).<br>

I have done internships as a SDE @OpenGenus and @LinkedIn. And have also been a Crio Launch student @crio-do. <br>
Besides coding, I like singing and sleeping :P
