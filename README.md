### Hi there üëã

Hi, I am Priyanka, a pre-final year student at UPES, Dehradun, pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science.<br>
I am an optimisitic, curious and well-focused developer. :sparkles: <br>

I love building web apps using MERN (MongoDb, Express, React and Node.js)  stack, and I  am currently diving deep into Cloud and Devops technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CircleCi ). I have also worked with Golang and GraphQL during my internship [@LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) <br>

I am also a Nanodegree graduate from Udacity for ‚ÄúCloud DevOps Engineer‚Äù. :cloud:

I have done internships as a SDE [@OpenGenus](http://www.opengenus.org/) and [@LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/). And have also been a Crio Launch student [@Crio.Do](https://www.crio.do/). :woman_technologist: <br>
Besides coding, I like singing :microphone: and sleeping :sleeping:
